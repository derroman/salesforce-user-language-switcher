# <img src="public/icons/icon_48.png" width="45" align="left"> Salesforce User Language Switcher

This little Google Chrome extension helps Salesforce users to switch their current user language with a single click. 

Working with customers who use their Orgs in multiple languages is always tricky and time-consuming, when it comes to translations and testing these.
In the current version of Salesforce you need 6+ clicks to change your own user language in your personal settings of Salesforce. 
And even worse, as the settings page does not open in a separate tab, you might even lose your current context. Annoying... 

And as we are developers and therefore love to make our lives easier, we've developed this little Google Chrome extension.

## Features

- Queries all available languages of a Salesforce environment
- Provides a list of languages which can be switch with a single click
- Page will reload automatically after language switch

## Remarks

- Switching to some languages might take a moment to refresh the Page, e.g. "Chinese (Traditional)"
- This extension only works in Salesforce Lightning (who uses Classic these days, anyway...)

## Install

This extension is available from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/salesforce-user-language/eibbnodeofbegdecjhomdblocokifman).
